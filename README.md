# GrowAGarden-Bot
A simple, easy to use bot for Grow A Garden stock.

# How does it work?
Currently I'm using websocket, but if you look at the bot's first commits, it used polling. 

# How to use 

- Install NPM, NodeJS
- Clone this git repo
- Rename .env.example to .env and fill in your bot token there
- Rename config.example.json to config.json and fill in your clientID.
- Go to ./functions/buildEmbds.js line 7 12 17 and change from getStockEmoji to getStock.
- Open up terminal and install the packages in package.json.
- Run the boy by node src/index.js or using nodemon src/index.js
- Give a star for this github repo :D

# WARNINGS
I am not responsible in anyway where the bot goes down. You may fork this bot knowing that errors should be fixed yourself. If you want, you can let me know about issues or errors on the issues page in the Github Repository.

This bot is still currently in development. Bugs should be expected.
