# GrowAGarden-Bot
A simple, easy to use bot for Grow A Garden stock.

# How does it work?
Currently I'm using websocket, but if you look at the bot's first commits, it used polling. 

# How to use 

- Install NPM, NodeJS
- Clone this git repo
- Rename .env.example to .env and fill in your bot token there
- Rename config.example.json to config.json and fill in your clientID, and API KEY
- Go to ./functions/buildEmbds.js line 7 12 17 and change from getStockEmoji to getStock.
- Open up terminal and install the packages in package.json.
- Run the boy by node src/index.js or using nodemon src/index.js
- Give a star for this github repo :D
